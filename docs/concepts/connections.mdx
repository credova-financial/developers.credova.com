# Connections

Connections are links between [Accounts](/concepts/accounts). A connection enables a merchant to process payments on behalf of a seller in a marketplace scenario.

A connection is created automatically when a seller accepts a [Connection Invitation](/api/create-connection-invitation).

When the Connection is created, the `id` of the Connection will be the same as the ID of the Connection Invitation.

## Retrieving Connections

You can [retrieve a Connection by ID](/api/get-connection-by-id) or get a list of Connections where you are the [Merchant side](/api/get-all-merchant-connections) of the Connection or where you are the [Seller](/api/get-all-seller-connections).
This enables you to see what other Accounts you are connected to.

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "id": "conn_73t7igFxDZvN9hypi7yoPwbxy",
  "merchant_account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
  "merchant_account_name": "Test Company, LLC",
  "seller_account_id": "acc_8ooQs32UCdriBvrHnVWbTmJbY",
  "seller_account_name": "Widgets Co",
  "status": "verified",
  "created_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z",
  "modified_at": "2024-06-30T01:02:29.212Z"
}
```

The connection contains several important pieces of information.

| Attribute             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`                  | This is the ID of the connection and can be used to retrieve the [connection by ID](/api/get-connection-by-id). This should be the same ID as the Connection Invitation.                                                          |
| `merchant_account_id` | If you were the one to invite a seller to connect with your account, this should be your account ID.                                                                                                                              |
| `seller_account_id`   | This is the seller's account ID. If you were invited to connect with a merchant's account, this should be your account ID.                                                                                                        |
| `status`              | This is the status of the connection. When a connection is first made, the status is `accepted`. This will move to `pending` when the seller completes onboarding and `verified` when the seller has been successfully onboarded. |

## Remove a Connection

At any given time, you can [remove a connection](/api/delete-connection) as either the seller or the merchant relationship in the connection. You can do this from within the [Credova Portal](https://portal.credova.com/connections) or as an API call:

```shell showLineNumbers
curl -L -X DELETE 'https://api.credova.com/connections/conn_73t7igFxDZvN9hypi7yoPwbxy' \
-H 'X-API-KEY: <API_KEY>'
```
