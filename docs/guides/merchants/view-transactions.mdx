# View Transactions

After completing the [Process Process](/guides/merchants/process-payments) guide, you may want to pull detailed information about the payment and transactions.

## Getting Started

<GettingStartedSection />

### Get your Secret Key

Next you will need your `Secret Key`. [Go to your Developers section](https://portal.credova.com/developers/api-keys) and click `Reveal` for your `Secret Key` and copy the value.

<Alert>Save the Secret Key as it will be used in the next steps of this guide.</Alert>


## Retrieve a Payment

We will need to reference the payment's `transaction_id` to pull information about the payment.

For example, given you have a payment:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "id": "pmt_2YKewBonG4tgk12MheY3PiHDy",
  "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
  "environment": "test",
  "status": "successful",
  // highlight-next-line
  "transaction_id": "trx_95rvMJvAVeG68W4NtLdfkN3LG",
  ...
}
```

We need to make a call to (Get Transaction)(/api/get-transaction-by-id) endpoint:

```shell showLineNumbers title="Get Transaction by ID"
curl 'https://api.credova.com/transactions/trx_95rvMJvAVeG68W4NtLdfkN3LG?include_type=true' \
-H 'X-API-KEY: <API_KEY>' \
```

Given the above examples, you should see a transaction response similar to:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "id": "trx_95rvMJvAVeG68W4NtLdfkN3LG",
  "account_id": "acc_B518niGwGYKzig6vtrRVZGGGV",
  "environment": "test",

```
